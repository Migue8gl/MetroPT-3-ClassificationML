# MetroPT-3 Dataset Analysis

This project explores the application of various machine learning algorithms, including **Naive Bayes**, **XGBoost**, **Decision Trees**, and **SVM**, on the **MetroPT-3 Dataset**. The dataset contains multivariate time series data from a metro train's Air Production Unit (APU), collected between February and August 2020. It includes 15 sensor readings (pressure, temperature, motor current, etc.) logged at 1Hz, totaling 15,169,480 instances.

## Dataset Overview
- **Purpose**: Predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction.
- **Features**: 15 attributes (7 analog, 8 digital sensors).
- **Challenges**: Unlabeled data with failure reports for evaluation.

## Algorithms
- **Naive Bayes**
- **XGBoost**
- **Decision Trees**
- **SVM**
- Other machine learning methods.

## Usage
This dataset is ideal for developing and testing predictive maintenance models, failure detection, and anomaly explanation tasks.
